docker build documentation
Every instruction (RUN) adds a layer
- compress multiple commands using \ && to reduce layers (however error prone)
Keep layers smaller
-shell tricks
-logic
Pass only what is neccesary to the next layer, clean up unnecesary artifacts


Multi-stage builds
-eliminates intermediate images and artifacts stored on disk
-create multiple "images" with multiple from statements (stages)
-pass specific artifacts betwen stages to include in final build
    FROM golang:1.7.3 AS builder AS GOSDK
    COPY --from=GOSDK /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/app .
-build up to a stage
    docker build --target builder -t alexellis2/href-counter:latest .

-use images and stages from external sources
    COPY --from=nginx:latest /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /nginx.conf
-use previous stage as new stage 
    FROM alpine:latest as builder
    RUN apk --no-cache add build-base

    FROM builder as build1
    COPY source1.cpp source.cpp
